# EX 27 C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

## Algorithm
```
1.Start
2.Declare a variable value of type char
3.Prompt the user to enter a value
4.Read the value using scanf
5.Check eligible for marriage
6.If age >= 21, print "Eligible"
7.If false, print " Not Eligible"
8.End
```

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
typedef int MyInt;
int main() {
 MyInt num = 10;
 printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num);
 return 0;
}
```
